h1. Aesthete.php

"One whose pursuit and admiration of beauty is regarded as excessive or affected."

Aesthete.php is an experimental library that lets you create arrays in a more "aesthetic" manner.
Returned arrays descend from the "ArrayObject":http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classArrayObject.html SPL class. Which is nice because it lets you add some methods, such as each().

h2. Usage

First, require it:

pre. require_once('aesthete.php');

Then use it to create an array of words and loop into it:

pre. w(' this is an array of words ')->each(function($w){
  echo "{$w}<br/>";
});

Or an array of any types and loop into it:

pre. a('one', 'two', 3, 4)->each(function($thing){
  echo "{$thing}<br/>";
});

Or a hash of strings and loop into it:

pre. h("
 key:            value
 another:        string
 number:         23
 a_long_string:  this is a long string
")->each(function($k, $v){
  echo "{$k} => {$v}<br/>";
});

h2. Minimum requirements

You'll need to have PHP >5.3 because of the AestheteHash and AestheteArray's each methods that takes an anonymous function.

h2. Disclaimer

Don't use this library in anything important where you care about speed or stability!
